        Hello! I’m a Computer Science and Math major with a deep passion for Linux, holding expertise as a Linux specialist. My enthusiasm extends beyond just using the system—I am a committed open source enthusiast, actively contributing to and learning from the community. I am currently seeking a position that allows me to leverage my skills in Linux, particularly in roles related to system administration and DevOps. My professional journey includes significant experience in IT at Managed Service Providers, where I’ve honed my technical and problem-solving skills. I’m also proud to hold certifications from CompTIA and RedHat, which underscore my commitment and expertise in the field. I am excited about the opportunities to bring my technical acumen and passion for Linux to a dynamic team, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue to grow in my career.
<br>I want this site to not only be a place where I advertise myself, but can also be myself. So here anything relating to my interests will be found. When I’m not immersed in the digital world, I love stepping into nature. Camping and hiking are my go-to activities for recharging and reconnecting with the outdoors. I also love watching and analyzing films, or consuming material on math, science, or cooking.
