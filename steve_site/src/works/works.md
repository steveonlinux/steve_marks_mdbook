These are links to my "books" or other writings. My goal is to solidify my own knowledge base while sharing whatever I know with others. I'm majorly self taught and promote [self-teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism#:~:text=Autodidacticism%20(also%20autodidactism)%20or%20self,teachers%2C%20professors%2C%20institutions). Everything here is perpetually in progress.
