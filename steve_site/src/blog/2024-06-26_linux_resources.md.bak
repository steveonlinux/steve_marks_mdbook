# Linux Learning Resources (2024-06-26)
I am currently a [RHCSA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa) who will eventually be an [RHCE](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhce). This requires me to keep my skills fresh. The learning seemingly never stops; there is always something else to know. Whether it be a new tool that is really cool, or a facet of something's design that is intriguing or indicates how it can be manipulated.
<br> All this constant learning and re-learning requires resources. I've read an untold number of documentation/wiki articles, and have watched *countless* Youtube videos on topics relating to Linux. Here, I want to document the resources that have served me best and that have provided the most digestible knowledge. Maybe it will help others. It will be categorized along the lines of format. Also, each resource will be rated from 1-5 penguins 🐧. The more penguins the better.

## Books
I find books the worst method of learning Linux. It isn't conducive to hands on learning. However, portions of these books so relay and explain underlying concepts pretty well. Most books take the form of that of a manual that is good for *referencing* but not *learning*. And even then, something printed on paper easily becomes outdated. Books that are meant for preparing for a specific exam are better as they often include lab material.

## Wikis
In my opinion, wikis are the best written resource. They often succinctly describe the nature of something and provide the most pertinent tools and their use cases. They are also written and maintained by the experts themselves. Examples are often provided as snippets that can be copied and pasted directly into a terminal.

## Websites
There are websites out their specifically dedicated to learning Linux. Some are small readings that include a quizzes for example. Others are hands on labs similar to something like [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/). Some are just there to help guide continuing education.

## Youtube Channels
The issue with Youtube channels relating to Linux is that they are often not related to administration at all. They are mostly from the perspective of a desktop user, abeit a poweruser. Some may lean towards admin more than others, and some may focus entirely on scripting. Regardless, these are the channels I've watched and enjoyed over the years, and have learned from greatly.
