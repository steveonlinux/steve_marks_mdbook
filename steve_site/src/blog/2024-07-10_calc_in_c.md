# Basic Calculus in C (2024-07-10)
## [Numerical Methods of Differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation)
I just wrote this up because I was curious about how to code calculus stuff which I had never done before. This lead me to falling down a rabbit hole on numerical methods.

Anyone who has taken Calculus in school is familiar with some numerical methods of differentiation or integration. The basis of the definition of a derivative is itself an approximation:

\\[ f'(x) = \lim_{{h \to 0}} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\]

A secant line where the distance between the two intersections is an infinitesimal.

I've recently learned that this is a class of method known as the *[Finite Difference Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method)* where a derivative is calculated using the same difference quotient with a finite distance that is sufficiently small:

\\[f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\\]

New to me is the *[Symmetric Difference Quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_derivative)* which also approximates the slope, but by using two secant lines equidistant from `x`.

\\[f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}\\]

The accuracy will be off by a proportion of `h` using the former method and by `h^2` using the latter one.

The accuracy will also be affected by the choice of forward, back, or central difference, round-off error, or truncation error, which funnily enough is often notated using [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation). 

## [Numerical Methods of Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration#:~:text=In%20analysis%2C%20numerical%20integration%20comprises,applied%20to%20one%2Ddimensional%20integrals.)

Riemann Sums is the other numerical method that is often learned to introduce the concept of an integral. And has been in use since antiquity - like when Archimedes approximated the area of the circle through [methods of exhaustion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion).

Riemann sums partition the area under a curve either from the left, right, or midpoint and if those partitions or slices are sufficiently small, you get a good approximation. This method utilizes rectangles:

\\[\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f\left( \frac{x_i + x_{i+1}}{2} \right) \Delta x\\]

But can utilize other polygons such a trapezoids:

\\[\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{\Delta x}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2 \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(x_i) + f(x_n) \right]\\]

There are a plethora numerical methods for both differentiation and integration that have been developed over the centuries that have their applications in engineering, manufacturing, physics, and computer science.

## Numerical Methods in C

Since these methods discretize functions they are how one could create algorithms to perform differentiation or integration. For example:

```c
// Forward difference method
double forward_difference(double x, double h) {
    return (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h;
}

// Backward difference method
double backward_difference(double x, double h) {
    return (f(x) - f(x - h)) / h;
}

// Central difference method
double central_difference(double x, double h) {
    return (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2 * h);
}
```
These c function will approximate a derivative given some function.

How about integration:

```c
// Trapezoidal rule function
double trapezoidal(double a, double b, int n) {
    double h = (b - a) / n;
    double sum = 0.5 * (f(a) + f(b));
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        sum += f(a + i * h);
    }
    
    return sum * h;
}
```

This will calculate an integral given a number of sub-intervals.

Or this:

```c
// Simpson's rule function
double simpsons(double a, double b, int n) {
    double h = (b - a) / n;
    double sum = f(a) + f(b);
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        double x = a + i * h;
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            sum += 2 * f(x);
        } else {
            sum += 4 * f(x);
        }
    }
    
    return sum * h / 3;
}
```

Which does the same according to [Simpson's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule).

## In Conclusion

Numerical methods seem essential to most calculus applications in the real world, however it isn't emphasized at all in the university calculus series. I'm glad I read up on it. I may update this with more advanced methods translated to c.
