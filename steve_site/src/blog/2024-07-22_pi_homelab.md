## What is an SBC?

A SBC or *single board computer* is a computer...on a single board. All the components, CPU, RAM, flash, i/o, on a single PCB or *printed circuit board*. They're usually really small and relatively inexpensive. They're commonly used for small hobbyist projects because they often have buses one can just shove raw wires into, they're small enough to cram into whatever you want, and have relatively low power usages. They are commonly associated with [*edge computing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing) and [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) or *internet of things*. These are two interrelated concepts involving smart fridges and toasters. Thermostats, air quality sensors, and home security systems. Washers and dryers. Even [soldering irons](https://pine64.com/product/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron/) and your girlfriend's [hair iron](https://glamoriser.com/product/glamorisor-bluetooth-smart-straightener/). Devices containing tiny computers connected to the internet, sometimes storing information and doing computations on a user's local infrastructure.

## Why Raspberry Pi?
It being the de facto option it has the most *support*. The Pi project has: a Linux distribution, hardware /software support, devices such as sensors and monitors, and forums. And the massive slice of the market Pi has means third party support is substantial as well. There are countless add on boards or HATs and enclosures that can be had. No matter the fact that competing SBCs may have comparable or even surpassing performance capabilities, many will choose Raspberry Pi due the overwhelming support. The greatest con is the availability. Raspberry Pis have historically been extremely difficult to come by. Especially considering memory shortages, and global pandemic, and a chip shortage over the last few years, the 4th model was essentially impossible to get, especially at retail. There are entire [databases](https://rpilocator.com/) dedicated to tracking retailer stocks. However, the release of the 5th model placated most and made obtaining at a reasonable price possible.

## What I Use Them For
Again there are a plethora of way to utilize a Pi due to the sheer amount of openness and attachable boards and devices. I personally use them in my homelab. I use them to host a variety of services, usually through containerization such as Docker. My Raspberry Pi 4s and 5s serve:
* DNS through [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/)
* Dynamic DNS through [ddclient](https://ddclient.net/) and [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/)
* VPNs through [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/)
* IP KVM using the [PiKVM board](https://pikvm.org/)
* File sharing through [Samba](https://www.samba.org/)
* Media through [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)
* Password management through [Passbolt](https://www.passbolt.com/)
* Site hosting through Apache and Nginx

*A freshly arrived piKVM*

*That piKVM running booted off of a USB*

I've used containers to run things like this as often as possible. Many utilities are available as container images on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/), however mileage may vary as ARM image are less common. I prefer containers due to the contained nature of the binaries and configurations. Everything can be contained in a single [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file, which is very convenient. 
In the past I've even had my Pis clustered using Kubernetes, but that was more for educational purposes. 
I've also experimented with different Linux distributions on Pis. There is of course Pi OS, the officially supported one. However,the major distributions have ARM versions that run on Pis and there are others specifically designed for Pis:

| Distribution         | Description                                                                                          | Website                               |

*For instance installing and running Gentoo on one was... an experience.*

All in all, Pis are a great way to learn and an even better way to run services at home at a low monetary cost and low power cost.
