# Over The Wire (Bandit) 🧑‍💻 (2024-07-17)
**[Link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)**

This is a *wargame* or ctf game that has the player interact with and penetrate a Linux system. The goal of each level is to retrieve a password or key located somewhere on a server. This can be used to access this next level, which is a user on the server.
# **SPOILER WARNING**
I will provide the prompt and hints to each level and my **answers**. I may describe my methodology, reasoning, or solution if it is warranted. Do not read if you intend on playing yourself.

## Level 0
>The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.
### Solution
* `ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
* Once logged in `cat readme` will output password to level 1.
* Password: `ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If`
## Level 1
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory
* `ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
* The name of the file containing the password needs to be referenced as a file as `-` is reserved for other uses in the shell.
* `cat ./-` will do the trick
* Password: `263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx`
## Level 2
> The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory

* `ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
* This is a similar issue as whitespace has a reserved use is shells as well. The file must be referenced by encasing it with quotes, `cat "spaces in this filename"` or by escaping the spaces, `cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename`.
* Password: `MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx`
## Level 3
> The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.
* `ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
* `cat inhere/...Hiding-From-You`
* Password: `2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ`
## Level 4
> The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.
* `ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
* This is the first level that doesn't essentially have a single solution. Essentially do whatever you need to to determine which file is human readable or cat everything to a file and sift through garbage until you see the password.
* Using `file` and a wildcard: 
```console
bandit4@bandit:~$ file inhere/*
inhere/-file00: data
inhere/-file01: data
inhere/-file02: data
inhere/-file03: data
inhere/-file04: data
inhere/-file05: data
inhere/-file06: data
inhere/-file07: ASCII text
inhere/-file08: data
inhere/-file09: data
```
Looks to be `inhere/-file07`.
```terminal
bandit4@bandit:~$ cat inhere/-file07
4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw
```
## Level 5
>The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:
human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable 

* Most automated solution is probably just using `find`
* `find . -size 1033c \! -executable`
 ```terminal
 bandit5@bandit:~$ find . -size 1033c \! -executable   
./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
```
* Can cat this in a one liner by running `find` in a subshell:
```terminal
bandit5@bandit:~$ cat $(find . -size 1033c \! -executable)
HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG
```
## Level 6
>The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:
owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

* Same deal as last level except different switches and searching from root.
* After running I also redirected `stderr` to `/dev/null` because there were too many permission denials getting in the way of reading output
```terminal
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null                                                 
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
bandit6@bandit:~$
```
* And we can cat it in a one liner for fun
```terminal
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat $(find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null)                                          
morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj
bandit6@bandit:~$
```
## Level 7
> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth

* First instinct is to `cat` then pipe into `grep` for "millionth".
```terminal
cat data.txt | grep millionth
millionth	dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
bandit7@bandit:~$
```
* Yup
## Level 8
> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

* First instinct is to cat then pipe into uniq maybe.
* My first instinct, `cat data.txt | uniq -u`, contains too many entries. After researching I realize that repeated lines need to be adjacent to be detected as repeated, so let's sort then pipe into `uniq`.
```terminal
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u                                                                                   
4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM
bandit8@bandit:~$
```
* Got it
## Level 9
> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.
* We can use `strings` to convert the garbage data to text, then grep the file for some "=".
```terminal
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt -d  | grep ==
[========== the
T%========== passwordG
}========== ist"
========== FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
bandit9@bandit:~$
```
* Password: `FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey`
## Level 10
> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data

From wikipedia:
>In computer programming, Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that transforms binary data into a sequence of printable characters, limited to a set of 64 unique characters. More specifically, the source binary data is taken 6 bits at a time, then this group of 6 bits is mapped to one of 64 unique characters.

* I can use `base64` to decode the data by piping into it from `cat`.

```terminal
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | base64 -d 
The password is dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr
```
* Success!
## Level 11
>The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

`tr` can be used to effectively rotate every character back.

```terminal
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'a-z' 'n-za-m' | tr 'A-Z' 'N-ZA-M'                                                     
The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
```
I need to learn tr syntax, I just found the implementation of [Rot13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rot13) in `tr` online and added rotation for capitals as well and piped the output a second time. That worked.

## Level 12
> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

* `mkdir /tmp/sm;cp data.txt /tmp/sm/; cd /tmp/sm`
* I will probably have to convert from hex to binary or something and uncompress that multiple times
* `xxd -r data.txt | gzip -d > out`
* `xxd` can convert data from hex to binary and vice-versa.
* `bzip2 out -d -c > out2 `
* `gzip out2 -d -c > out3`
* `tar -xvf out3`
* `tar -xvf data5.bin`
* `bzip2 data6.bin -d -c > out7`
* `tar -xvf out7`
* `gzip data8.bin -d -c > out9`
```terminal
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/sm$ cat out9
The password is FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/sm$
```
* I gave up on renaming every time so the scheme is inconsistent, but I just checked the output using `file` every time to determine what decompression algorithm or archival tool to use until it was completely unwrapped as a text file.
* Password: `FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn`
## Level 13
> The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
```terminal
bandit13@bandit:~$ cat sshkey.private

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```
* I will copy this key to my host's `~/.ssh` directory and login by forcing the use of the key for access: `ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i .ssh/id_bandit14 `
* I'm in!
## Level 14
> The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30000 on localhost**.

* I can `cat` the password referenced in the last level and pipe it into `netcat` to send it to the port.
```terminal
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | netcat localhost  30000                                                  
Correct!
8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
```
## Level 15
>The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.
Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

* I will need to encrypt what I send to the port beforehand. This can be acchomplished with openssl's s_client.
* From the man page: 
>DESCRIPTION
       This command implements a generic SSL/TLS client which connects to a remote host using SSL/TLS. It is a very
       useful diagnostic tool for SSL servers.

``openssl s_client -ign_eof -connect localhost:30001``
* I then manually enter the password 

```terminal
8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
Correct!

```
* Mission accomplished!
## Level 16
> The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

* I will search for candidate ports
```terminal
bandit16@bandit:~$ netstat -tulpn

bandit16@bandit:~$
```

* 31691, 31046, and 31960 are candidates
* However none are over ssl, the port may be open but not listening. I can scan with `nmap`.
```terminal

bandit16@bandit:~$
```
* It was port 31790 and a key was returned, I will add it to my host's `~/.ssh`.
``ssh bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i ~/.ssh/id_bandit17`` works!

## Level 17
> There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new
> NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19
* We can just `diff` to find the differing line:
```terminal
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old 
42c42
< x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
---
> FtePUTiLiwPzjIFw2T7o57oBS4zUvPpg
```
So the password is: `x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`
## Level 18
>The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

* I know that you can pass a command to `ssh` to be ran rather than initializing a shell
* `ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 'cat readme'`
* The password was returned:
```terminal
bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8
```
## Level 19
> To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

```terminal
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do 
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
```
* Evidently, we can use this binary to `cat` bandit20's password since it is the owner of the file that contains it. 
```terminal
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20                                                              
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
```
## Level 20
> There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21). NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

* I believe I have to connect to a port of my choosing using the `suconnect` binary and then send the password to that port while it is open. I have some options. I can either use a multiplexer or throw `suconnect`'s process to the background.
* I am mistaken, it it the other way around. I must send the password to the port first, then `suconnect` grabs it.
```terminal

## Level 22
> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

```terminal
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
bandit22@bandit:~$
```
* Based on this, the password whose name was hashed by `md5sum`
* I will manually run the command using "bandit23" as `myname` in a subshell and cat the appropriate file.
```terminal
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/$(echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga
```

## Level 23
> A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.
NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!
NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…

```terminal
bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24 
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
bandit23@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```
* Based on the script that is being run by cron, we just need to write a script that gets the name of bandit24's password for us. This script executes every script in `/var/spool/bandit24/foo/` if it is owned by bandit23 then deletes it. However, the script will be ran as bandit24 since it is that user's cronjob. Therefore, I can get the contents of `/etc/bandit_pass` from a script in `/var/spool/bandit24/foo/`.
* I am having an issue getting output from the script presumably due to permissions. I modified the target directory with `chmod 777`. 
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 >> /tmp/sm2/out.txt
```
This did the trick:
`gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8`
* Success!
## Level 24
>A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time

* This is the script I've formulated:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

code=0
while [ $code -le 9998 ];
do
        code=$((code+1))
        pass="gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 ${code}"

        echo "Trying code $pass"
        echo $pass | nc localhost 30002 -w 1 | tee -a out.txt
done
```
* But it is very slow, there must be a faster way.
* Firstly, it starts at 0 because it just increments it doesn't handle every digit independently. 
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {0000..9999}
do
  pass="gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 ${i}"
  echo "Trying code $pass"
  echo $pass | nc localhost 30002 -w 1 | tee -a out.txt
done
```
* This is better! Didn't know bash supported iterating over ranges this way. Now looking into improving speed. Could utilize parallelization in some way. I could:
	* Throw the jobs into the background with a max number running any time
	* Utilize `parallel`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

export pass_prefix="gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 "

generate_and_try() {
  i=$1
  pass="${pass_prefix}${i}"
  echo "Trying code $pass"
  echo $pass | nc localhost 30002 -w 1 | tee -a out.txt
}

export -f generate_and_try
export pass_prefix

# Generate the sequence and run in parallel
seq -w 0000 9999 | parallel -j 100 generate_and_try
```
* `parallel` handles the parallelization... luckily it is installed...
* Instead of a loop this solution utilizes `seq` to generate codes
* The code is passed as a cmdline arg
* I will then search the output for the string "Correct". One could also `grep -v` the string "Wrong".
```terminal 
Correct! The password of user bandit25 is iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4
```
* Success!
## Level 25
>Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

* I know that default shells are in `/etc/passwd`.
* `cat /etc/passwd | grep -i bandit26` yields `bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext`
* `showtext` is a script:
  ```bash
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

exec more ~/text.txt
exit 0
  ```
* And there is a key in the home directory 
```terminal
ls

* The solution for this was ultimately simple yet very elusive. So the text contained in `~text.txt` was too short to do anything with and would immeditaly exit. I explored for any possible ssh switch or techqiue I could employ. I checked every permission. But the simpliest solution was just... **to make the window smaller**... That forces `more` to enter an interactive mode since all the text can't be displayed. From there you cna evert Vi and do whatever you need to. 
* I first redefined the shell:
* `:set shell=/bin/bash`
* And enter a shell from Vi using`:shell`
* Now I am in and technically in:

* Looks like there is a binary with the `suid` bit set allowing me to run it as bandit27 since they are the owner and bandit26's group has execute permissions on. The binary evidently takes a command as an argument to be ran. I used this to get the password for bandit27.

* System File Locations and Root Directories
	* `etc/passwd`, `/tmp`, `/bin
* Processes
	* `&`, `bg`, `fg`, `tmux`, `screen`, `ps`
* Scheduling
    * `cron`
* Shells
	* `bash`, `sh`
	* Environment Variables and Arguments, `$0`, `TERM`
* Base Conversions, Encoding, and Hashing
